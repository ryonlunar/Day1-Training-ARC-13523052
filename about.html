                    I am currently studying at the <span>Institute of Technology (ITB)</span> as an Informatics student, now in my 3rd semester. Throughout my academic journey, I have learned a lot, expanding my knowledge in various aspects of computer science and software development. Along the way, I have also achieved notable accomplishments, including success in competitions and earning a scholarship, which has been a great source of motivation for me.

                  Despite the challenges of adapting to the rigorous academic environment and the ever-evolving world of technology, I continuously strive to find my own way of learning. I actively seek opportunities to grow, whether through hands-on projects, competitions, or self-directed study. My goal is to absorb as much knowledge and experience as possible, ensuring that I can develop both technically and personally in this field
